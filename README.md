Myning Recipe is a dashboard developed for social media analysis that focuses on cyberbullying. The project was focused on the Malay Language to identify the cyberbullying form that appears in social media, especially X(previously known as Twitter). The 'Myning' refers to the process of extracting data(tweets) from social media and most of the data used is from the @huseinzol05 dataset used in sentiment analysis. On the other hand the word 'Recipe' refers to the algorithm used in the project which consists of Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. The highlighted algorithm/recipe use was a BERT language model developed by Mesolitica and it was fine-tuned using a labeled dataset about cyberbullying.

## Problem Statement
1. There are too many cyberbullying cases happening on social media.
2. Lack of Malay language utilize in cyberbullying detection.
3. A lack of dashboard to analyze the pattern of words in cyberbullying.

## Objective
1. Produce a prototype that can be utilized in social media to prevent users from posting cyberbullying tweets.
2. Enhance the usage and availability dataset gather from @huseinol05.
3. Create a dashboard for analyzing the pattern of words consisting of tweets that usually lead to cyberbullying.


## Acknowledgement
Feel free to use my labeled dataset(be careful some of it has a misclassified label) and model for further improvement or research purposes. Special thanks to @huseinzol05 for providing the Malay tweet dataset and a lot of tools for analyzing text in the Malay language. The analysis tool can be seen on the demo page later.

## Declaration
Myning recipe is my final year project which was one of my requirements for completing my bachelor's in computer science. There are many things that can be improved in this project since it has a lot of 'trade-offs'. Stay tuned for upcoming planning on making more improvements and adjustments that can be used in the future, as there will be more 'recipes' and new version.
