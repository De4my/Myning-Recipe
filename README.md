Myning Recipe is a dashboard developed for social media analysis that focuses on cyberbullying. The project was focused on the Malay Language to identify the cyberbullying form that appears in social media, especially X(previously known as Twitter). The 'Myning' refers to the process of extracting data(tweets) from social media and most of the data used is from the @huseinzol05 dataset used in sentiment analysis. On the other hand the word 'Recipe' refers to the algorithm used in the project which consists of Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. The highlighted algorithm/recipe use was a BERT language model developed by Mesolitica and it was fine-tuned using a labeled dataset about cyberbullying.

## Problem Statement
1. There are too many cyberbullying cases happening on social media.
2. Lack of Malay language utilize in cyberbullying detection.
